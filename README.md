How do I approach writing software?

- What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- What design process did you follow for your project work?
- How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?<br>

My typical design process begins by clearly defining the project's goals. This often involves gathering user feedback, but sometimes it's simply a personal list of objectives. For this project, the goal was to replicate an original image. My approach was to break down the image into individual objects and consider the best methods for recreating each one. From there, I followed my standard design process. Identifying specific shapes is similar to starting with the smallest components and building upwards. Once the shapes were defined, I focused on color, texture, material, and lighting in succession. This incremental approach maintains momentum and allows for refinement at each stage.

How do I approach developing programs?

Additionally,<br> 
- What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
- How did iteration factor into your development?
- How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?<br>
***
As previously mentioned, my typical approach involves defining project goals followed by incremental development. While I didn't explore new strategies, the specific steps varied from previous projects. Instead of building a database and then adding user interaction, I focused on creating shapes and refining their visual appearance. Iterating through this process yielded the desired visual outcome.

- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future **educational** pathway?
- How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future **professional** pathway?<br>

Creating visuals in this manner was a new experience for me, but it aligns with contemporary development trends. The ability to manipulate objects on a screen is essential for fields like game development, an area of interest for me even though not my current career path. The skills acquired in this course will undoubtedly be valuable for future projects.
